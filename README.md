# Adult salary prediction with scope on Random forests hyperparameters, overfitting, and feature importance
In this project, [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)'s [
Adult Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult) to predict whether an American individual earns more than $50,000 a year given a number of numerical and categorical features (A binary-calassification task). 

Several classifiers were trained and hyper-parameter tuned to perform the tast in this project to find the best performing classifier. Moreover, Random Forest and Decision Trees were closely investigated for their hyperparameters , max_depth for Decision Trees, and n_estimators for Random Forest. In addition, overfitting and underfitting were investigated ,in addition to discussing about feature importance for each of the models,
